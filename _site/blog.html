      <h2 id="am-i-a-hotshot-engineer">Am I a hotshot engineer?</h2>
<p>I’ve spent the last year and nine months working for Atlassian, one of the most renowned software companies out there. As a grad hire straight out of college, I’ve been working thus far as a full-stack engineer for the Statuspage team. 
I had reached the point where I began to feel quite confident in my work. I felt I had a firm handle on the majority of our Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, React codebase. For most smaller sized tasks, I could get them over the line without too much trouble. I began to ask myself - ”How can I keep development interesting, and continue to learn, when I have a task that, for the most part, I already know how to implement?”
A major contribution to this issue at that moment was my sub-team had recently been handed projects that weren’t quite as technically challenging. So how could I keep myself challenged? Besides working on a project dealing with a technical aspect I hadn’t worked with before, I wasn’t sure what to focus on to improve. Or, to be frank, that there was anything I needed to focus on.</p>
